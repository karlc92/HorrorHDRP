Support for Unity 2022 ended with the Drag&Drop Volumes update version 8.1. 

However, you can still download "Drag&Drop Volumes" version 8.1 for Unity 2022 here:

I encourage you to switch to Unity 6 and enjoy the new Volumes with each new update, which will no longer be available for the 2022 version.
